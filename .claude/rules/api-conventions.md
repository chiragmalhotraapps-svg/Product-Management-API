# API Development Rules
When editing any file under src/:- All route handlers must be wrapped with catchAsync from 
src/middleware/catchAsync.js- Validators must be imported from src/validators/ — never define validation 
inline in routes- The response envelope { success, data, error } must be used for every JSON 
response- Never assign to req.body directly; use destructuring to pick only known fields- status field must be validated against the enum: active | inactive | 
discontinued- archivedAt must never be settable by the caller — it is internal state only- id and createdAt must never be writable via PATCH or POST body
