# Testing Rules
When editing any file under tests/:
- Use node:test and node:assert/strict — do not import Jest or Mocha- Import the Express app from src/app.js, never from src/index.js- Call productModel.clearAll() inside beforeEach to reset state between tests- Each test must be independent — do not share product IDs across tests- Seed realistic data: use different categories, prices, and stock levels- Assert both the HTTP status code and the response envelope shape
