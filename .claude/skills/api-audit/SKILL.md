## Files under review

## Audit checklist
Review the files above and check each item. Report severity as Low / Medium / 
High.
### Security- Mass assignment: can a caller set id, createdAt, or archivedAt via request body?- Input validation: are all required fields validated before the model is called?- SKU enumeration: does findBySku expose whether a private SKU exists?- Sensitive field exposure: is archivedAt visible in API responses to consumers?- Search injection: is the partial-match search safe against regex or injection 
attacks?
### Performance- findAll() complexity: is it O(n) per call with no indexing?
- Are Maps used for O(1) lookups by id and sku?- Are there any synchronous blocking operations inside async handlers?
### Code quality- Are all async handlers using catchAsync?- Is validation kept out of route handlers and controllers?
